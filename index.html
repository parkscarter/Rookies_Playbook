      <h2 class="text-uppercase">Sports Betting, Moneylines, and Spreads</h2>

      <p>
        Sports betting is a popular activity where individuals place wagers on
        the outcome of sporting events. There are various types of bets,
        including moneyline bets and spread bets.
      </p>

      <div class="bet-type">
        <h3>Moneyline Bets</h3>

        <p>
          In a moneyline bet, you simply pick which team you think will win the
          game. The odds are presented in terms of a positive or negative
          number. A negative number indicates the favored team, while a positive
          number indicates the underdog. For example, if Team A has a moneyline
          of -150, you would need to bet $150 to win $100. If Team B has a
          moneyline of +200, a $100 bet would yield a $200 profit if Team B
          wins.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="bet-type">
        <h3>Spread Bets</h3>

        <p>
          Spread betting involves betting on the margin of victory in a game.
          The favored team has to win by a certain number of points (the spread)
          in order for the bet to pay out. Conversely, the underdog can lose by
          less than the spread or win outright for the bet to be successful.
          Spread betting adds an extra level of excitement to sports wagering,
          as it allows you to bet on the performance of a team relative to
          expectations.
