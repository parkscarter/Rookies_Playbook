          Hello, this is the midterm assignment as a part of Com S 319 at Iowa
          State. Throughout the first few weeks of this class, we've learned basic
          concepts relating to web development. Led by Dr. Ali Jannesari, we've
          learned how to place images and text onto a page with HTML, and we've
          learned how to manipulate those fields using css in order to achieve a
          desired style. Throughout the remainder of the semester, I expect we
          will give our web pages some life by including javascript functionality.
          After that, I assume we will learn about backend and databases, which
          will likely include material about frameworks like Node.js and react
